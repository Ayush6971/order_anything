# Project Directory Structure

## ./

The index.js file initializes the Node Express app and sets up the routes folder to handle all further routing.

## /routes

All route handling to direct traffic to the correct controller

## /controllers

Handles all incoming requests and serves the resulting view and information. Data requests are sent to the Models directory and page layout are sent to the Views Folder

## /models

The models are driven by the sequelize node package. Each model represents either a table or a view in the kilobyte database. Models can be generated with the sequelize-auto node package. A few edits are needed after the code is generated:

- Field names to match data name.
- File and Model name to match table name.
- Timestamps set to false OR find fields to match createdAT and updatedAT fields.
- Make sure there is a primaryKey set.

## /middlewares

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.
in this project middleware is in r-index file.
